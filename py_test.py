"""   
helps to simplify the process of writing, organizing and executing tests. It can be
 used to write a variety of tests including: integration, end-to-end, and functional tests. 
 It supports automatic test discovery and generates informative test reports. 

In this reading, you will learn more about pytests, how to write tests with pytest, and its fixtures.

How to write tests
Pytests are written with functions that use the operation, assert(). An assert is a commonly used 
debugging tool in Python that allows programmers to include sanity checks in their code. They ensure
 certain conditions or assumptions hold true during runtime. If the condition provided to assert() turns 
 out to be false, it indicates a
 bug in the code, an exception is raised, and halts the program’s execution. 
 Typically, code provides an assert condition followed by an optional message. An example is: 

"""

def divide(a, b):
	assert b != 0, "Cannot divide by zero"
	return a / b

"""An AssertionError message is raised
 informing the programmer that it is not
   possible to divide a value by zero."""


"""Pytest fixtures
Fixtures are used to separate parts of code that only run for tests. They are
 reusable pieces of test setups and teardown code that are shared across multiple 
tests. Fixtures benefit developers by assisting in keeping their tests clean and 
avoiding code duplication. Let’s look at an example of using a pytest in Python:"""

import py_test

class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.cubed = False


    def cube(self):
        self.cubed = True


class FruitSalad:
    def __init__(self, *fruit_bowl):
        self.fruit = fruit_bowl
        self._cube_fruit()


    def _cube_fruit(self):
        for fruit in self.fruit:
            fruit.cube()


# Arrange
@pytest.fixture
def fruit_bowl():
    return [Fruit("apple"), Fruit("banana")]


def test_fruit_salad(fruit_bowl):
    # Act
    fruit_salad = FruitSalad(*fruit_bowl)


    # Assert
    assert all(fruit.cubed for fruit in fruit_salad.fruit)


"""
In this example, test_fruit_salad  requests fruit_bowl. When pytest recognizes this, 
it executes the fruit_bowl fixture function and takes the object it returns into test_fruit_salad 
as the fruit_bowl argument. 
Key takeaways
Pytest is a user-friendly testing framework for developers writing code in Python to
focus on creating simple and clear tests. Pytests are written using the assert() operation to compare actual values with expected results.
Fixtures provide developers a way to share common test data and environment configurations while ensuring consistent testing conditions.  
"""

"""
Both unittest and pytest provide developers with tools to create robust and reliable code through different
forms of tests. Both can be used while creating programs within Python, and it is the developer’s preference on which type they want to use.
In this reading, you will learn about the differences between unittest and pytest, and when to use them.

Key differences
Unittest is a tool that is built directly into Python, while pytest must be imported from outside your script.
Test discovery acts differently for each test type. Unittest has the functionality to automatically detect test
cases within an application, but it must be called from the command line. Pytests are performed automatically
using the prefix test_. Unittests use an object-oriented approach to write tests, while pytests use a functional approach. 
Pytests use built-in assert statements, making tests easier to read and write. On the other hand, unittests provide special 
assert methods like assertEqual() or assertTrue().

Backward compatibility exists between unittest and pytest. Because unittest is built directly into Python,
these test suites are more easily executed. But that doesn’t mean that pytest cannot be executed. Because of
backward compatibility, the unittest framework can be seamlessly executed using the pytest framework without
major modifications. This allows developers to adopt pytest gradually and integrate them into their code.
Key takeaways
Unittest and pytest are both beneficial to developers in executing tests on their code written in Python.
Each one has its pros and cons, and it is up to the developer and their preference on which type of testing framework they want to use.
